# All-Pairs-Similarity-Spark


All-Pairs-Similarity-Search is an important function for clustering similar objects within large datasets. APSS is used in a wide variety of important use-cases such as:

- recommendation systems (e.g. Netflix finding users similar to you so they can recommend movies)
- fraud/plagiarism detection (finding near-duplicate essays)
- spam detection (e.g. google comparing every email recieved by a user to known spam-emails)

# Building


This package is set up with sbt and assembly. Run sbt clean assembly to create a jar in the target/scala folder. Requires Spark 1.5.2.


#running

The spark command for the sample dataset is:

```
# extracts current directory
export DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

spark-submit --class edu.ucsb.apss.Main apss-1.0.jar $DIR/1k-tweets-bag.txt
```
The package comes with the following options


| short option |      long option      |                               description |
|----|:-----------------:|---------------------------------------------:|
| -i |      --input      |                               The input file |
| -t |    --threshold    |       The threshold for PSS, defaults to 0.9 |
| -n |    --numLayers    |     Number of layers for PSS. Defaults to 21 |
| -h | --histogram-title | Title for histogram, defaults to "histogram" |
